# Heel House
PearlHacks Roommate Matching App
Made by Caitlin Estrada (@caitlinestrada27), Sanjana Gopalswamy (@sgopal08), Sadie (@sadiesawyer), and Caroline Bryan (@cgbryan1)

#### Inspiration
Our inspiration stemmed from roommate finding difficulties. We referenced existing roommate matching apps such as RoomSync to create an app that can be used by all UNC Chapel Hill students, regardless of their housing plans.

#### What it does
Heel House is a roommate matching app. It takes input from the user's profile and finds potential roommates that have similar compatibility. The user can swipe "right" to match with them or "left" to pass on them. Users can see who they matched with under the "Matches" page and edit their profile under the "Profile" page.

##### How we built it
We built Heel House using Swift/SwiftUI through XCode. We used Canva to design our logo and Figma to create wireframes for prototyping. We also utilized Github to manage versions and allow collaboration between members of our team.

##### Challenges we ran into
Our team had difficulty getting the simulations on Xcode to run on many of our devices, and we encountered issues with pushing/pulling from Github as well. We also ran into issues with Auth0 to create a UNC Chapel Hill domain-specific log in page to ensure that only UNC Chapel Hill students could sign into the app. Unfortunately, we faced many complications during the set up process. We downloaded multiple softwares, however with the unclear documentation we were unable to complete the implementation. However, we hope to further research Auth0 implementation and add this as a feature in the future!

##### Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of our proudest accomplishments is the development of our innovative swiping feature, which adds a dynamic and engaging element to our platform. Paired with our clean, minimalistic design, we've crafted an intuitive user experience that prioritizes simplicity and ease of navigation. Countless hours were dedicated to fine-tuning every aspect of our interface, ensuring that users can effortlessly browse and connect with potential roommates. Our commitment to seamless functionality and aesthetic excellence sets us apart and enhances the overall satisfaction of our users.

##### What we learned
Through this project, we gained experience in Swift and SwiftUI, languages previously unfamiliar to two members of our team. Their dedication and willingness to learn enabled us to master these softwares effectively. Moreover, we delved deep into the intricacies of screen navigation, mastering the implementation of buttons, basic gestures, and animation techniques like the swiping feature. This learning journey not only expanded our skill set but also reinforced the importance of adaptability and continuous learning in our team's ethos.

#### What's next for Heel House
In the future, our vision for Heel House involves integrating the Auth0 UNC login page, ensuring that our platform caters specifically to Chapel Hill students, fostering a more localized and personalized experience. Additionally, we aim to enhance user satisfaction by introducing additional customizations to our profile pages and refining our algorithm to match users with the most compatible roommates seamlessly. Our focus remains on continually improving and tailoring Heel House to meet the evolving needs and preferences of our users within the UNC community.
